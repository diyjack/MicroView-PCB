You've never seen an Arduino™ compatible like this. With a built-in OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode Display) you can see what your Arduino is thinking without having to connect it to your computer. 

No more cryptic "Hello World" LED blink sequences or shoehorning oversized displays onto your tiny Arduino™. Development is much easier when you can see what's going on.
